# Treehouse-FEWD-Project-1 "Random Quote Generator"

Practice your knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax and data structures by building a Random Quote Generator, a program that displays a randomly selected quote each time the user clicks a button. 

This project highlights my understanding of basic vanilla JavaScript.  I did not use any jQuery in this project as it was and still is my goal to be great at vanilla Js before leaning on any libraries.
